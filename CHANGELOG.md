- **Superior Uptime**: ü¶æ Reliability is a top priority. This upgrade brings even more robust uptime for DDS integrations.
- **Increased Conversion**: ‚ÜóÔ∏è We are leveraging system level features to increase conversion.

N/A

### [2.3.4](https://github.com/underdog-tech/react-native-pinwheel/releases/tag/2.3.4)

#### Added

- Export `EventPayload` type.
- Export `PinwheelError` type.
- Export `PinwheelErrorType` type.
- Export `EmptyPayloadObject` type as `Record<string, never>`.

##### Updated

- `EventPayload`¬†is no longer a union containing `{}`. It now contains `Record<string, never>` instead due to [this behavior](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/FAQ#why-are-all-types-assignable-to-empty-interfaces).
- Mark exported `Error` type as **@deprecated** because it collides with the built-in javascript `Error` object. Replaced with `PinwheelError`.
- Mark exported `ErrorType` type as **@deprecated** because the new naming convention is prefixing with "`PinwheelError`". Replaced with `PinwheelErrorType`.
- Update `onExit` type to be `(error: PinwheelError | Record<string, never>)` to be accurate with current functionality.
