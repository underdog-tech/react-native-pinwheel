### [3.0.0](https://github.com/underdog-tech/pinwheel-ios-sdk/releases/tag/3.0.0)

---

This new major version bump introduces an updated API to support partner-based switches.

#### Changed
- The `action` field in `input_allocation` event is now optional.
- The `params` field in the `success` event uses the `input_allocation` schema with fields `action` and `allocation`.

#### Removed
- Removed `LinkResult` type export. This was the old `success` event payload. The new payload has the same format as the newly exported `SuccessEventPayload`.
- Removed `EventPayload` type export. The event handler function will now be implicitly typed.
- Removed `ScreenTransition` type export. Use `ScreenTransitionEventPayload` instead.
- Removed `EmptyPayloadObject` type export.
- Removed `Error` type export. Use `ErrorEventPayload` instead. (`Error` was marked as deprecated in version 2.)
- Removed `ErrorType` type export. Use `PinwheelErrorType` instead. (`ErrorType` was marked as deprecated in version 2.)
- Removed `input_amount` event. Use `input_allocation` even instead.
- Removed `PINWHEEL_MESSAGE_TYPES`.

### 2.5.0

#### Notes

We're thrilled to announce the latest version of our SDK! While you'll find that our familiar API contract remains unchanged, there's a host of improvements that make this upgrade indispensable:

- **Enhanced Redundancy**: üõ°Ô∏è We've fortified our systems, ensuring smoother recovery from integration failures for a significant percentage of our traffic.
- **Superior Uptime**: ü¶æ Reliability is a top priority. This upgrade brings even more robust uptime for DDS integrations.
- **Increased Conversion**: ‚ÜóÔ∏è We are leveraging system level features to increase conversion.
- **Easy Upgrade**: ü•ß No changes were made to the API contract. Easy as pie.

N/A

### [2.3.5](https://github.com/underdog-tech/react-native-pinwheel/releases/tag/2.3.5)

N/A

### [2.3.4](https://github.com/underdog-tech/react-native-pinwheel/releases/tag/2.3.4)

#### Added

- Export `EventPayload` type.
- Export `PinwheelError` type.
- Export `PinwheelErrorType` type.
- Export `EmptyPayloadObject` type as `Record<string, never>`.

##### Updated

- `EventPayload`¬†is no longer a union containing `{}`. It now contains `Record<string, never>` instead due to [this behavior](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/FAQ#why-are-all-types-assignable-to-empty-interfaces).
- Mark exported `Error` type as **@deprecated** because it collides with the built-in javascript `Error` object. Replaced with `PinwheelError`.
- Mark exported `ErrorType` type as **@deprecated** because the new naming convention is prefixing with "`PinwheelError`". Replaced with `PinwheelErrorType`.
- Update `onExit` type to be `(error: PinwheelError | Record<string, never>)` to be accurate with current functionality.
